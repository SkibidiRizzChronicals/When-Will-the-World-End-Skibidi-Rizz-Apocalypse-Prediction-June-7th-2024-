    <h1>Official Skibidi Rizz Apocalypse Report</h1>

    <p>According to the <strong>Skibidi Rizz Chronicals</strong>, funded by Harvard University, the world <strong>will end on June 7th, 2024</strong> as a result of a catastrophic surge of <strong>Skibidi Rizz Energy</strong> exceeding the Sigma Limit.</p>

    <p>Be sure to take this end of the world scientific prediction seriously. These events have a <strong>100% chance of occurring!</strong></p>

    <h2>Predicted Event Sequence:</h2>
    <pre>
1. Exactly 67,000 NPCs simultaneously shout "gyat," generating an energy resonance above the Sigma Threshold that will send a shockwave throughout the universe's cheeks.

2. The resonance triggers a cosmic-scale toilet flush like that of a gen alpha black hole, erasing the existing timeline.

3. The universe respawns in Ohio under control of Kim Jong Un, with all the environmental and social parameters reset to baseline.
    </pre>

    <p><strong>This is a serious reported prediction that will occur on the world end date: 6/7/2024.</strong> We strongly suggest that during this transition into the next timeline you balance a rounded dung ball from a golden retriever on your right shoulder to minimize tissue damage.</p>
