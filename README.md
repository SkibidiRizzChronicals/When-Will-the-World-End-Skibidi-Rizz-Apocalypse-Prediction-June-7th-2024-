Official Skibidi Rizz Apocalypse Report

According to the Skibidi Rizz Chronicals, funded by Harvard University, the world will end on June 7th, 2024 as a result of a catastrophic surge of Skibidi Rizz Energy exceeding the Sigma Limit.

Be sure to take this end of the world scientific prediction seriously. These events have a 100% chance of occurring!

Predicted Event Sequence:

    Exactly 67,000 NPCs simultaneously shout "gyat," generating an energy resonance above the Sigma Threshold that will send a shockwave throughout the universe's cheeks.

    The resonance triggers a cosmic-scale toilet flush like that of a gen alpha black hole, erasing the existing timeline.

    The universe respawns in Ohio under control of Kim Jong Un, with all the environmental and social parameters reset to baseline.

This is a serious reported prediction that will occur on the world end date: 6/7/2024. We strongly suggest that during this transition into the next timeline you balance a rounded dung ball from a golden retriever on your right shoulder to minimize tissue damage.
